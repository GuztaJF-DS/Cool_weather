# Cool_weather

hello this is a project for my moblie application programming class

the idea is that this project takes data from Api from Hg Weather (Link :https://hgbrasil.com/status/weather), and with that you can give a weather forecast for several places in the world, and compare if the forecast for today was right

Versions:

1.0: Added the main features of the project, such as the weather forecast, the current climate, the comparison in a basic version, as well as a system to detect the person's city based on their latitude and longitude
